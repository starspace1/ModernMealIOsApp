## Homework - Build Me Something Beautiful 

Create any app you want, using any technology or framework that we've already learned, or even one we haven't. The only constraint is that the app you present on Monday morning must be _done_. You can define _done_ however you'd like, but the presentation cannot include any half-finished or broken code.
